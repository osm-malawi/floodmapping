# Background
The Consortium of MRCs, OpenstreetMap Malawi, and Nkhoma University have been granted funding by the Humanitarian OpenstreetMap Team (HOT) through the Eastern and Southern African Hub (ESA) to map the regions heavily impacted by Cyclone Ana, specifically Chikwawa and Nsanje. The project aims to produce geospatial data that will aid in disaster recovery and planning efforts. While, they are implementing the project another devastating cyclone Freddy has hit the same region. Malawi Red Cross with its consortium members organised Mapthon events yet following its planned activities. 
- Cyclone Ana
- Cyclone Idai

These damaged critical influstructure,  disturbed well being of people.

For development of solutions locations that have high likelihood of being exposed have to be identified and solutions are supposed to be developed based on that.

# Method

# Study Community

The study targets Nsanje and Chikwawa districts in Southern Malawi. The study area has an elevation between 30 and 938 meters above sea level.  

- Talk about low elevation, talk about local rivers in the districts including passerby (Shire River)

We also had 17 females and 12 males which was more than the expected turn up and also high number of female participants. Most participants were busy with exams as they were closing the first half of the semester and they had to join the activity soon after they finished the exams, the other problem was internet connectivity whereby the internet had shut down for approximately 45 minutes and we managed to switch to different service providers.',

On the other hand, members reported that deforestation uphill is worsening the floods in the area. They also mentioned the new road which forms a dam for water, hence the water drains with higher velocity in the culverts. They suggested intensifying tree planting and conservation uphill. Additionally, they suggested that tarmac roads must have culverts away from the communities.',

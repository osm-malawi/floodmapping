Additionally, they mentioned that Donors have specific groups they always target and neglect others despite needing an immediate solution. On the other hand, members reported that deforestation uphill is worsening the floods in the area. They also mentioned the new road which forms a dam for water, hence the water drains with higher velocity in the culverts. They suggested intensifying tree planting and conservation uphill. Additionally, they suggested that tarmac roads must have culverts away from the communities.',
